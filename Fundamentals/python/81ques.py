#3. Create a class “Employee” with a function “hello_employee()”. Now, create an object 
# of the class and demonstrate the function overloading. When“hello_employee()” is called 
# without any argument (e.g., none), it should print only “Hello”, else when called with 
#employee name as argument, it should print “Hello $Employee Name$”. (Concept:Method Overloading)

# class Employee:
#     def hello_employee(self, name=None):
#         if name is None:
#             print("Hello")
#         else:
#             print("Hello", {name})
            
# emp = Employee()

# emp.hello_employee()  
# emp.hello_employee("rajat saxena")
